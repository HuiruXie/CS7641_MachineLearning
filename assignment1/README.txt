Link to the datasets:
Dataset 1：Obesity Dataset，https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/544/estimation+of+obesity+levels+based+on+eating+habits+and+physical+condition
Dataset2： Income Dataset，https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/2/adult

**Note**: 
Due to the presence of some samples with missing features in the income dataset, I manually removed them during preprocessing. 
Therefore, I highly recommend using the CSV file that I have processed. 
Both the CSV file and the code have been uploaded together to 这里写你传的地方.
